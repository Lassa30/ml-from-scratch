### Brief development plan
1) Implement basic shape and stride operations
2) Handle reshaping, resizing, views
3) Implement an add and multiply methods with the overloads
4) Write a dummy autograd for the operations above
### No coding tasks
- Find a tool and generate a dummy docs to make it easier to recall what the code does
